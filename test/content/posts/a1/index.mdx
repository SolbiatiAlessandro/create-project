---I got my hands on [Landau, Course of Theoretical Physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Course_of_Theoretical_Physics). I want to challenge my understanding of the book by writing a physics engine that provide a computational layer for the book chapter by chapter.

\>>> Just another Physics Engine

Out there you can find any sort of stuff if you are interested in physics engines, from general computation frameworks like [Mathematica](https://www.wolfram.com/mathematica/) to game engines like [Unreal](https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/?lang=en-US). A good textbook on physics engines is [Structure and Interpretation of Classical Mechanics](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/structure-and-interpretation-classical-mechanics-second-edition), an unusual physics textbook that approach the subject from computational perspective.

Even if originally I had the idea of building the Physics Engine in Lisp, I wanted to build something that works in the web, so I eventually turned my attention to Javascript. [three.js](https://threejs.org/) looks like a good starting point for the 3d rendering part, and turns out it works also in virtual reality: I managed to build [an immersive 3d website](https://github.com/SolbiatiAlessandro/threejs-getting-started) in a couple of hour that run on my [Oculus Quest](https://www.oculus.com/quest/?locale=en_GB).

\>>> The double-pendulum

[Landau](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Course_of_Theoretical_Physics) starts off describing Lagrangian mechanics and leaves as a exercise to the reader to find the equation of motions for a double pendulum, e.g. a pendulum attached at the end of another pendulum (see the [double-pendulum on ScienceWorld](http://scienceworld.wolfram.com/physics/DoublePendulum.html) for a good treatment of the problem).
