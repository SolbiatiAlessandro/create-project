    <p>I got my hands on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Course_of_Theoretical_Physics">Landau, Course of Theoretical Physics</a>. I want to challenge my understanding of the book by writing a physics engine that provide a computational layer for the book chapter by chapter.</p>

<p class="subtitle"> &gt;&gt;&gt; Just another Physics Engine </p>
<p>Out there you can find any sort of stuff if you are interested in physics engines, from general computation frameworks like <a href="https://www.wolfram.com/mathematica/">Mathematica</a> to game engines like <a href="https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/?lang=en-US">Unreal</a>. A good textbook on physics engines is <a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/structure-and-interpretation-classical-mechanics-second-edition">Structure and Interpretation of Classical Mechanics</a>, an unusual physics textbook that approach the subject from computational perspective. </p>
<p>Even if originally I had the idea of building the Physics Engine in Lisp, I wanted to build something that works in the web, so I eventually turned my attention to Javascript. <a href="https://threejs.org/">three.js</a> looks like a good starting point for the 3d rendering part, and turns out it works also in virtual reality: I managed to build <a href="https://github.com/SolbiatiAlessandro/threejs-getting-started">an immersive 3d website</a> in a couple of hour that run on my <a href="https://www.oculus.com/quest/?locale=en_GB">Oculus Quest</a>. 
</p>
<p class="subtitle">&gt;&gt;&gt; The double-pendulum</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Course_of_Theoretical_Physics">Landau</a> starts off describing Lagrangian mechanics and leaves as a exercise to the reader to find the equation of motions for a double pendulum, e.g. a pendulum attached at the end of another pendulum (see the <a href="http://scienceworld.wolfram.com/physics/DoublePendulum.html">double-pendulum on ScienceWorld</a> for a good treatment of the problem).
